## Usage

### JS-Search

JS-Search is an embeddable form of our [React-Search](https://github.com/vectara/react-search) component. Try that component's [demo](https://vectara.github.io/react-search/) to see how this widget will appear and behave on your site.

Add this script tag to the `<head>` tag of your website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vectara/js-widgets/lib/js-search.js"></script>
```

Place a `div` in the body of your page with an ID assigned to it. The JS-Search script will insert the search widget into this element.

```html
<div id="vectaraSearchElement"></div>
```

Then, at the bottom of your website's `<body>` tag (or in your own JavaScript code), add the following code:

```html
<script>
  window.vectara.renderSearch({
    wrapperId: "vectaraSearchElement", // The ID assigned to the div you made earlier
    customerId: "CUSTOMER_ID",
    corpusId: "CORPUS_ID",
    apiKey: "API_KEY",
    placeholder: "Search", // Optional search input placeholder
    isDeepLinkable: true, // Optional boolean determining if searches will be deeplinked (modifies page URL)
    openResultsInNewTab: true, // Optional boolean determining if links will open in a new tab
  });
</script>
```

### JS-Chatbot

JS-Chatbot is an embeddable form of our [React-Chatbot](https://github.com/vectara/react-chatbot) component. Try that component's [demo](https://vectara.github.io/react-chatbot/) to see how this widget will appear and behave on your site.

Add this script tag to the `<head>` tag of your website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vectara/js-widgets/lib/js-chatbot.js"></script>
```

Place a `div` in the body of your page with an ID assigned to it. The JS-Chatbot script will insert the chatbot widget into this element.

```html
<div id="vectaraChatbotElement"></div>
```

Then, at the bottom of your website's `<body>` tag (or in your own JavaScript code), add the following code:

```html
<script>
  window.vectara.renderChatbot({
    wrapperId: "vectaraChatbotElement", // The ID assigned to the div you made earlier
    customerId: "CUSTOMER_ID",
    corpusIds: ["CORPUS_ID_1", "CORPUS_ID_2"],
    apiKey: "API_KEY",
    title: "My chatbot", // Optional title of your chatbot window
    placeholder: "Ask a question", // Optional chatbot window input placeholder
    inputSize: "large", // Optional string specifying the input size ('large' or 'medium')
    emptyStateDisplay: document.getElementById("emptyState"), // Optional HTMLElement to display if the chat window is empty
    isInitiallyOpen: true, // Optional boolean determining if the chatbot window will be open on initial render
    zIndex: 5, // Optional number assigned to the z-index of the chatbot window
  });
</script>
```

### Set up your data

The widgets use the data in your Vectara corpora to provide responses. To set this up:

1. [Create a Vectara account](https://console.vectara.com/signup).
2. [Create a corpus and add data to it](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/creating-a-corpus).
3. [Create a **QueryService** API key](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/console-ui/manage-api-access#create-an-api-key).

**Pro-tip:** After you create an API key, navigate to your corpus and click on the "Access control" tab. Find your API key on the bottom and select the "Copy all" option to copy your customer ID, corpus ID, and API key. This gives you all the data you need to configure your widget.
